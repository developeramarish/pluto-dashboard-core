# Pluto Dashboard Core

Pluto Dashboard Core is using ASP.NET Core, Angular, and React.

We prefer ASP.NET Core because it is a cross-platform, high-performance, open-source framework for building modern,cloud-based, Internet-connected applications, web apps and services, IoT apps, and mobile backends.

We prefer a modern JavaScript and TypeScript both of Angular and React.
